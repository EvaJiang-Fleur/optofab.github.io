> First audit is a chance for us to work together with our client OptoFab to exchange our ideas and discuss various options for our product. We share our presentation with three other teams, set a scope for our project for this semester and get feedback from our shadow team. Meanwhile, our team can always benefit a lot from our tutor Tim’s perspectives and experience in better managing our project from the very beginning.
