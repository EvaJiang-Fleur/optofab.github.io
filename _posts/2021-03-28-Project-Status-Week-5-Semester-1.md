> During week 5, we have more in-depth conversations with our client on working out different layouts for our order flowchart on the website.

## Accomplishments

- Signed agreements and Statement of Work with clients.

- Gathered requirements from clients regarding website interface.

- Drafted user interface design for the online customer order system.

  - Completed 3 customized order layouts for “request a part” on the website, 1 left to discuss next week. [3/4]

  - Started reviewing client’s source code for code implementation next week

## Next Steps

- Prototype the user interface for the customer order system on the website.

- Initiate design for the local database

  - Keep communicating with client during teaching breaks

  - Sketch a prototype for the front-end in parallel for iterations

## Risk and Project Issues

- The website prototype needs to acquire approval from the ANU IT department.

- Clients may change requirements halfway through the prototyping process, and changes in the future are inevitable which means our product must be adaptive and flexible when designing the prototype.

- Need to ensure the project is technically feasible and scalable.
