- Started gathering database requirements from clients.

## Next Steps

- Test on the local server.

- Build database relational schema with clients.

## Risk and Project Issues

- Need to test the website on server environment.

- The clients' requirements on database are complex, therefore, it is important to make sure they are feasible.
